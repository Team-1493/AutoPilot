#  A class representing a profile that determines how Autopilot approaches a target.
#
#  The constraints property of the profile limits the robot's behavior.

#  Acceptable error for the controller (both translational and rotational) are stored here.
#  The "beeline radius" determines the distance at which the robot drives directly at the target and
#  no longer respects entry angle. This is helpful because if the robot overshoots by a small
#  amount, that error should not cause the robot do completely circle back around.
